## Another project that will probably never see fruition

This should generate random 3 dimensional models of mushrooms

Steps of this:
1. Define a schema to categorise all the attributes of a mushroom
    (stem length, thickness, if there's a skirt, spore ring. Cap size, waviness, shape, colour. Gills straight or honeycomb or other, attachment pattern (if straight), density. Growth patterns - single, clusters, clumps etc)
2. Generate new attributes (of a species) (spore ie seed the rng, store seed as spore)
3. Use that species definition to grow new mushrooms
3. Each attribute should have a generator class, that takes the attributes and generates a point cloud (or 3D info) from them
4. Work out how to render the 3D information
5. Add colours and textures and stuff, and additional attributes eg phosphorescence)
6. Generate and set as desktop background on login or something, idk
